# Orbital selection

This example rotates the O, S, and V spaces separately to align them with the following orbitals, taking the largest from each space:

(3d4d) - (3p) - (3p) - (3d4d)
(5S,5V) - (3D) - (3D) - (5S,5V)

However, because both bridging oxygens are completely filled, they are Slater determinants, and thus orbital rotation gradients between them are zero.

CMF then finds that mixing the metals with the briging ligands, provides a way to get some correlation, which destroys locality. 
I think we need to have at least some correlation in each of the clusters.
