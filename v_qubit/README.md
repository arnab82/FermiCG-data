The experimental structure is take to be 4 from the above paper. 
However, the most interesting from a QIS perspective appears to be 1, which didn't have a CIF file. 
I've made one here, in `v_qubit_1.xyz`. This was optimized at the B3LYP-D3/6-31g* level. 
The QChem input file is also provided in `v_qubit_1.inp`.
